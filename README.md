# Greetings ðŸ˜Ž

I'm Iain. I'm a software engineer @grafana. I'm on the Cloud Platform team,
which provides resources for other engineering teams at the company to deploy
their stuff into.

I'm also a Debian Developer and an Ubuntu Core Developer.

In a former life, for a very long time I was an engineer on the desktop team at
Canonical, where we made Ubuntu desktop.

ðŸ—£ Talk to me about:

  * Linux distributions
    * Ubuntu
    * Debian
  * Debian packaging
  * The autopkgtest.ubuntu.com system and how it works
  * GNOME and desktop Linux in general
  * Why daytime naps are great
