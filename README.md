# Greetings ðŸ˜Ž

I'm Iain. I used to be a software engineer on the Desktop Team @canonical. I'm
still a Debian Developer and an Ubuntu develoepr too.

ðŸ—£ Talk to me about:

  * Linux distributions
    * Ubuntu
    * Debian
  * Debian packaging
  * The autopkgtest.ubuntu.com system and how it works
  * GNOME and desktop Linux in general

I'll soon be starting @grafana. Then I'll fill this `README` in a bit more
comprehensively. Mainly I just found out that it existed and wanted to write
something here.
